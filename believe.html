                <h3>Working for a Better Tomorrow</h3>
                
                Only some things can be solved overnight; you can only expect things to get better by putting in some of the work first. There is a time to believe and a time to work. Sure, they do collide a lot of the time, but it is essential to know when you must do more than believe and put in some of that work to make that better tomorrow happen. You need to do more than believe; you need to work for what you believe. You cannot expect things to always go your way. You must do something about it to make your belief a reality.  
                <br>
                I have seen people keep telling themselves tomorrow will be better but that tomorrow never comes because they are afraid to do more. Knowing when it is necessary to work is critical; otherwise, you will end up in the same spot as yesterday. It can simply boil down to a feeling of inadequacy and a realization that you can make tomorrow better. That is the kind of feeling I got hit with while in school. 
                <br>
                In my first year of high school, I needed to be more motivated and willing to work for the things I wanted. I believed that if I did the bare minimum, I would pass and feel good about what I was doing and putting toward the class. I did pass my class; however, I was close enough to fail that I got scared of what would happen if I did not do more. I was never motivated to do anything for this class, which ended up showing in my grades. I almost ended up failing the class in my first semester. That was my wake-up call to start working for the outcome I wanted, or else it would all stay the same, and I would be getting nowhere.  
                <br>
                The realization came as a slap in the face when I got my final grades. I succeeded; however, I was not happy with the grade I ended with. During the first semester, I just believed that what I was doing was all I could do, but once that realization hit, it became clearer that there was much more I could have done. Of course, teachers are there to help you and tell you what to do, but that only goes so far. For an unmotivated kid, teachers telling me what to do felt like a suggestion and nothing more.
                <br>
                More people should be working for that better tomorrow, like I was not at the beginning of school. You see people just going about their day, not wanting to change. But you need to know when it is okay to change and when it is needed to change. I’m not saying to stop hoping for that better tomorrow because sometimes that is all you can do. But by putting in a bit of extra work, I believe we can make tomorrow more than better.
