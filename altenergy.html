                Hydropower uses water sources like rivers, oceans, and lakes to provide and store energy. This is done through dams, run-of-river systems, and in development, tidal wave power. Both dams and run-of-river systems have already been designed and been placed into action providing about 6.2% of total energy in the US (1: Energy.gov, n.d.). But tidal power is a new development that might make hydropower one of the best forms of alternative energy. It produces energy from the rise and fall of tides on shores (National Geographic Society 2022), there are many designs that are being tested currently from tidal turbines and paddles on the floor of the body of water that flap back and forth with the tide. 
                <br>
                The cost is actually less than most other alternatives as it uses the body flowing body of water. Whoever just like every other alternative like solar and wind there is an unavoidable high upfront cost, it is not cheap to produce dams or run-of-river systems but in the long run it ends up paying for itself as it has little maintenance and upkeep cost (Energy.gov, n.d.). To offset the cost of these structures' older structures like bridges, tunnels, and other dams can be used as a base for the new structure (2: Energy.gov ).  
                <br>
                I chose this Source of energy as I fell it still has a long way to go to being fully harnessed but once it is it will be a major contributor to alternative energy. It may be costly at first, but water is a renewable resource meaning it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
