                Device security is a must in today’s age, and having an outdated system or security measures is a threat in itself. Hackers and other cyber attacks need to be prepared for accordingly so no company details get leaked to unwanted sources. These preparations can consist of software and hardware updates, uncorrupted backups, and third party protection services. Updated systems will allow for your devices to be managed and configured properly with new protection services. Having operational backups will prepare you for when a system threat happens, and you need to restore your devices data. With third party protection services like VPN, you can rest assured that your data is still protected even when connected to unsecure networks that are not your own.

                <h3>Update of Current Operating System for Kimberly-Clark Paper Company</h3> 

                With the current OS (operating system) that is installed, windows XP, there are currently 30 computers in the building and other peripheral devices connected to those computers. There have been many ransomware attack threats. These attacks threaten to render all files, devices, and any systems that rely on those devices unusable. The successful attacks lock users out of their computers and require payment to get back in; these are called locker ransomware attacks. These attacks have been successful due to the outdated OS.  

                <h4>Company Problem </h4>

                With everyone in the company working from computers on the same network with no current protection besides what the OS provides, these attacks can spread through that network and infect other computers on the same network. If this were to happen, the whole building would have to cease operations until the threat is dealt with since all the computers are on the same network. Then after IT has taken care of the danger, every computer would need to be restored to a previous backup taking up more company time. 

                <h4>System Update</h4> 

                The need for security is high, as our files and clientele records are private. Hackers cannot be allowed to lock the user out of their computer and have access to that personal data. By implanting software updates to the newest version of windows, windows 11, comes more specialized security configurations against ransomware. New settings are now located in the Virus and Threat Protection in system settings and can be managed from there. A new update feature that comes with windows 11 is windows defender, this is used to protect from malicious attacks (National Cyber Security Centre 2021). Knowing how to configure these settings and making sure they are on and working are important, as you don’t want to not be utilizing something that can help prevent attacks. Installing and updating the system will allow for new patches that protect against threats and attackers to the computer software that have been exploited. It is crucial to be prepared for when or if this happens again. 

                <h4>Offline Back-ups </h4>

                Backing up your system and data is the first step in preparing against threats. According to the CISA, “backups should be conducted on a regular basis” and should also be done offline. Doing the backups offline will prevent ransomware variants from trying to delete your backup before the system is restored, and you should not have to pay ransom for your company's data. (CISA, 2020). Regardless of whether it is online or offline, backups need to be done regularly, and you never know when an attack will hit, and being prepared for the attack is essential.  

                It is also important to have multiple backups done at a time and stored on separate systems, doing this will provide another layer of protection against attackers, especially since windows is often a target for these attackers (Preston 2023). And having these multiple backups will also ensure that you will always have a copy of your data on hand. So if one of the backups gets corrupted and becomes unusable, you will have another one to restore your data from. 

                <h4>VPN Protection</h4> 

                Another security measure that must be put in place is a VPN (Virtual Private Network) on every computer connected to the network. A VPN is also used to protect against identity theft, which will put the employees at ease as they use the network. A VPN will act as a private network connection right to the internet. Any employee that works from home or not at the office will need a VPN to ensure no company data is being eavesdropped on while on an unsecured network. The VPN will help protect you from hackers who want to steal your data by encrypting it securely, requiring an encryption key to look at it. This will ensure that company data is not being eavesdropped on or exploited while connected to their network.  

                <h3>Design </h3>

                There are two ways to approach the design of the new system; it can be bundled and coded into a new application with all the listed features, or we can download already available programs that match the description of the features provided. If a new application is created, it will take more time to implement and cost more. However, you can customize any features down to the application's core. Many coders and developers will need to be hired to create the application, which will cost more to implement. The other more cost-effective approach would be downloading previously made applications that specialize in the features listed. This would cost less in the long run and take much less time to implement, as all that would need to be done is installing and configure the applications on the systems. 

                Let's go with the ladder half and download specialized applications. This will be more cost-effective and ensure that the features requested are working right off the bat. The requested features are automatic windows updates, backup solutions, and business VPN. Going this route, Figure 1 provided by Zhao, Y. Nutanix.  

                we will only have to install two applications onto the systems, the backup solution and the VPN. As with the new windows update comes features that allow you to schedule updates for the future, so all that would need to be done is to install the new windows and configure it to your liking for future updates. The windows update will be free with every system. For the backup solution, I suggest the use of Barracuda. This system allows you to customize your order to the company's needs at a relative price. The VPN will come as a subscription-based service; if Barracuda is used for the backup solution, it will also come with a VPN service.   

                The data center in this diagram represents the backup server and the company's central server. The VPN will provide protected access for the office as well as any home office workers to the data center. 

                <h3>Implementation</h3> 

                The windows installation and the VPN will be installed on one computer at a time, appropriately adjusted, and tested before going on to the next device. Once the update and VPN service are installed and working correctly, the next step is to start implementing the new backup solution. This will entail the installation of the new server and connecting each device to the new server. After the server and applications are set up and running a backup will need to be performed with all the new settings adequately adjusted. 

                <h4>Resources</h4> 

                For the windows update, the only thing that is needed is an internet connection to download the update from the windows system website. If multiple devices are updating at once, then the internet connection will need to be checked to ensure that it can handle that much activity without majorly slowing down. The IT team will install the VPN from the Barracuda website. First, you will need to log in to the website and provide the company's information and login credentials to ensure the purchased VPN is installed. The new backup server will need its room if one still needs to be provided. The installation will consist of replacing the outdated server with a new one, then connecting the new server to the switch through the correct ports. During this process, if any cables are damaged, they will need to be replaced. After installing all the other applications and the new server, the IT team must log in to every computer and reconnect the device to the new server. 

                <h4>Estimated Timeline</h4> 

                The new Windows update installation can take 10 to 20 minutes and proceed with a system reboot. This can be done with multiple devices simultaneously, shortening the time it takes to update and reboot. They are making it a total of 8 to 16 hours to update the entire office of 50 computers. Then once the update is installed next, the VPN will be installed on every computer one by one and configured right then to ensure that it is correct. It will take 15-20 minutes per computer to install and log in to that VPN. Depending on how big the IT team will be for this, it could take up to a whole day to complete. While all of that is happening, the backup server can be installed to save time on the project. The backup server will take the longest to install, as you first have to set up the server itself and then go into every computer to connect it to that new server. This would again be a whole-day project, depending on when the other installations are completed and how many team members will work on the project. 

                <h3>Testing</h3> 

                The last step is testing all the applications to ensure that they are all running smoothly and as requested. Everything will be tested one by one, to begin with. Once the windows update is installed, it will be tested by the IT team first, then once the VPN is installed, that will be configured and tested to ensure the device can securely connect to the network. Then the backup solution will be tested and adjusted to meet the company’s requirements. The windows update is a simple test, you need to make sure the computer can boot up and log in to the new update once it is installed. To test the VPN, first, it will need to be turned on. Then a message and/or symbol will pop up on the system notification page. If the message pops up, you will know that the VPN is connected and will provide secure access.  

                The backup solution will take longer to test. To test the backup solution, you must back up your system to the new location. Then you will have to retrieve that data backup and analyze it. You will know if the backup is successful if everything backed up was recovered and not corrupted. If the backup is corrupted, you will not be able to reinstall the backup into the system, and a screen will pop up when rebooting your system telling you this. If a success, the system will boot back up with no error screen and run just like it had before the backup. Then you will have to ensure that the data backed up with the system is still intact. This is done by opening up documents backed up with the system. If the document opens without problems, it is not corrupted.

                Summary: In the article, seven different ways to secure your data are presented, all based on different ways to back up your system. Having multiple backups is important for a company, and having those backups performed differently will allow for multiple up-to-date company records. If one backup is corrupted, you have other backups to choose from when restoring a device is needed. It is also important to have these backups done securely so that hackers can not get access to your information if your device is infected. When information is restored, you are not restoring a corrupted backup once again, infecting your system.
