                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                
                The outdated financial aid program is doing nothing more than creating debt that most people only get to pay off 21 years later. It is only supposed to take ten years to pay off. Most students need to realize how much they are paying for college in general and how much tuition costs make up; it is more than half of their expenses. Even with financial aid helping you pay, you are still put in debt to the government for many years after college. For many, this is a turn-off for even trying to attend college, even when their dream depends on that higher education. They do not want to be in that kind of debt in this economy, so they give up on that dream and all the experience that comes with college. To ensure people's dreams and improve our society, we need to make college more affordable and spread all the good that comes with college.
                <br>										

                <h3>Background information</h3> 

                The cost of attending college can be divided into four main groups; tuition, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses/fees. According to Melanie Hanson (2022), "The average cost of in-state tuition alone is $9,377; out-of-state tuition averages $27,091."(para. 1), with the average cost of attendance being $25,707 for an in-state college and $43,421 being the average for an out-of-state college. Remember, this is the yearly cost to attend, and these numbers have increased drastically since the 2000s. And with people not being able to pay for that in full every year, even with payment plans, most resort to seeking financial aid. Financial aid is calculated by subtracting your expected family contribution (EFC) from your cost of attendance (COA) to determine your need-based aid. EFC is calculated by your family's income, what benefits your family has, and if your family has any assets. Things like income changes for higher or lower are also estimated in the calculation, most of the time not being fully accurate. 

                <h4>Financial Aid Problem</h4>

                The current outdated financial aid program is doing nothing more than creating debt for college students, and for that reason, it could use a change. Financial aid helps a student by providing them with a loan based on current income and class status. Even with all the help financial aid can bring, it hardly does so, with no real long-term solutions being put in place. Long (2010) argues that "After decades of financial aid policy, there are still significant gaps in college access by income, even after accounting for differences in academic preparation and achievement by income." (para. 2). The current program does not do much to help even when financial aid factors in changes in a family's income or how much they have already saved. People are still in massive amounts of debt with no end in sight; that is because there is no long-term solution being thought of or being put into action. 
                <br>
                Just recently, Biden has been pushing for a student debt relief program. Now, this is no long-term solution, for it only applies to borrowers "â€¦if their individual income is less than $125,000 or $250,000 for households." (Federal Student Aid, para.4) and is only providing relief up to $10,000 to those that have not received a Pell Grant and $20,000 for those that have. Biden's solution cannot be the long-term solution because every college student accumulates more debt than they are offering to relieve. I am not saying this will not help but realistically, the average debt for a newly graduated college student is 30,000 or more. For most, this will only pay for a third of that debt, and with interest rates still being applied and paying for everything outside of college for a newly graduated student, you will still be in debt for years after.

                <h4>The Price for Dreams</h4> 

                A high number of newly graduated high schoolers are now avoiding college for fear of being in debt for the rest of their lives, even if their dream relies on having a higher education. Students are starting to realize the cost of their dreams, and when it comes to college, that dream could end up costing them their entire savings. Many college students end up working part-time jobs to keep them afloat during their years there. Goldbrick-Rab claims that with everyone going into debt and some facing far worse, they are giving up on their dreams and steeling for something they do not want to do. Some simply just cannot afford college, to begin with, and some cannot risk being in that much debt for something that might not work out. But it all leads back to affordability and how even some middle-class families cannot afford it anymore. (As cited in Wall Street Journal, 2018).
                <br>
                With the price of tuition steadily increasing along with everything else in the economy, the realization that college is not affordable, even with financial aid to help them, is starting to settle in. Elizabeth Ratliff comments on how "...she was mortified by the dramatic increase in current tuition prices..." (As cited in Dias, 2016). People are giving up on their dreams to settle for something less or for something they do not want to do, all because they are letting their fear of debt drown out all the benefits of college. 

                <h4>A More Educated Society</h4>

                With the stress of debt and financial burdens lifted off students' shoulders comes a more enriched and upward-thinking society, with numerous studies already showing that college students "are more socially connected, civically engaged, and active in their communities than those without a degree. "College graduates have more extensive systems of social support and a larger number of close friends." (Cox para. 3, 2021). A college degree does not just come with a possibility for a higher paying job but also better social skills and more engagement with society and its people. Cox (2021) also states that "...Americans who graduated from college have larger friendship networks than those who did not graduate from college do."(para. 10) showing that college is not simply good for getting a degree but also developing better friendships and networks. Yet not everyone will be able to experience that because the rising rates for college tuition are turning them off from attending.  
                <br>
                College has many more benefits regarding mental health than we are led to believe. Most will think that college is just a breeding ground for parties and stress without realizing all the good things that can come from it. College students are more active in their communities by having what is called a "Third place," Cox (2021) describes a "third place" as somewhere college students go outside of their university or dorms, like a bar, restaurant, park, or coffee shop, really any public place that they regularly attend. This "third place" contributes to feelings of less loneliness because you are around people you know and are familiar with, whether they are neighbors or friends. And with college being accessible to all, making this experience available to everyone, it will not be just society benefiting from it, but the students attending will also. With more people being social and contributing to their communities, both society and communities will grow and flourish as the students engage more with their college experience. 

                <h4>The Benefits Toward Communities</h4> 

                College does not just benefit oneself, but it also enriches the community. Studies show that students who graduate from college are more likely to do acts of service toward their communities, whether that is volunteer work, community service, or donations to charity. These students are more likely to provide those services compared to students that graduated just from high school. There is a significant jump in the percentage of volunteer work from high school graduates that contribute 17%, to college graduates that contribute 49% to their community (Trostel p.54). The same gap is shown in contributions to community projects and services. 3.6% of high school graduates contribute to projects, and 17.3% of college graduates contribute to projects in their community (Trostel p.64). College graduates benefit communities in many ways that few people realize. And by making college a more accessible possibility for high school graduates' communities could grow exponentially, with higher volunteer counts to more community service acts being completed. College brings growth to communities and society. 

                <h3>Opposing views</h3>

                Most ask how college would end up being paid for if we had free tuition. The simple answer would be the taxpayers themself. McCluskey argues that putting that burden of education on the shoulders of taxpayers would create even more stress than it would relieve (As cited in Wall Street Journal, 2018). But he fails to realize that we are already paying for public libraries, K-12 schooling, and other community things through those taxes. Would it not be a promising idea to invest more in making higher education possible for all? With a larger educated workforce will come a new generation of workers motivated to do what they are interested in, bringing more quality goods and innovations to the table. Is this not worth having that extra burden in the scheme of things? 
                <br>
                McCluskey also argues that having "...workers with up-to-date technical expertise; habits of mind that include analytical thinking, problem-solving and cooperative behavior; a strong work ethic and a commitment to lifelong learning." (As cited in Wall Street Journal, 2018) is too much to ask for these days. However, he does not consider that all those skills start while in college and are built and improved on while attending. These skills are not too much to ask for; they apply to all jobs, degree or not. Each of those skills is not just built-in college but also improved outside of college, with hands-on training, different job experiences, and improved social skills, all of which create experience.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3> 

                With college rates rising by the year and no long-term financial aid solution, people are starting to give up on their dreams of college without knowing all the benefits that it could bring. Not just benefits towards society or a better paying job, but also better social skills and networks, along with better mental health and physical abilities. Yet nobody is talking about these benefits because they do not know about them. And with the fear of debt already turning them off, how are they supposed to get back on the path to a better society?
